## What is the commercetools sync?

commercetools sync is a Java library that could be used to synchronise in any of the following ways:

1. Synchronise data coming from an external system in any form (CSV, XML, etc..) that has been already mapped to 
[JVM-SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk) resource draft objects 
(e.g. [CategoryDraft](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk/blob/master/commercetools-models/src/main/java/io/sphere/sdk/categories/CategoryDraft.java)).

2. Synchronise data coming from an already-existing commercetools project in the form of 
[JVM-SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk) resource objects 
(e.g. [Category](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk/blob/master/commercetools-models/src/main/java/io/sphere/sdk/categories/Category.java)).


Currently this library supports synchronising the following commercetools resources:-
- [Category]()
- InventoryEntry
